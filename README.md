# Prerequisites

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

# Installing Playwright

Clone the repository and execute the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install
```

# Configuring Environment Variables

Rename `.env.sample` to `.env`, and update the environment values.

For local testing, set the URL to `localhost` or `candig.docker.internal`. All the credentials can be found in the `CanDIGv2/tmp/keycloak` folder.

# Running Tests

All the tests can be run by using:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

However, itâ€™s recommended to run each project separately with specific settings.

### Running UI Tests

```bash
npx playwright test --project=ui --workers=1          # Run all tests with a single worker
npx playwright test --project=ui --ui                 # Run interactive mode
npx playwright test summary                           # Run a specific file
npx playwright test summary -g "diagnosis graph"      # Run a single test
```

### Running API Tests

```bash
npx playwright test --project=api --workers=100 --repeat-each=100   # Adjust the number as needed
npx playwright test tyk                                # Run a specific file
npx playwright test tyk -g "tyk service-info"          # Run a single test
```

# Test Folders

There are two main groups of tests, each organized into its own folder: `ui-tests` and `api-tests`.

### UI Tests

The `ui-tests` folder contains tests that simulate user interactions with the data portal. These tests verify basic frontend functionality, such as:
- Page loading
- Component rendering
- Button clicks
- URL redirection
- Display of expected results (e.g., number of cohorts, patients)

All UI tests should be placed in the `ui-tests` folder and use the `.ui.ts` extension for proper test matching.

### API Tests

The `api-tests` folder contains a series of API calls to assess service performance, primarily focusing on API response times. It is recommended to run API tests with parallel workers and repeat tests multiple times to gather sufficient data for later analysis.

All api tests should be placed in the `api-tests` folder and use the `.api.ts` extension for proper test matching.

# Updating the Tests

Tests are based on a small dataset with admin credentials. Adjust the results for different dataset.

### UI Tests

For UI tests, delete all the snapshots inside the `snapshots` folder and rerun the tests. This will generate new snapshots. Then, update the expected values in each test accordingly.

### API Tests

API tests do not verify the returned values. Simply create or delete the relevant endpoint tests as needed.

# Report

Test reports are available in the `playwright-report` and `blob-report` directories.

**Note:** Reports are overwritten each time the tests are run. To keep a report, rename the files before running new tests.
